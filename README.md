# Project Based Learning
Inspired by https://github.com/tuvtran/project-based-learning#additional-resources, I am listing projects I am interested in completing. These projects are mostly focused on Embedded and Graphics Programming.

## Projects:
- [ ] [Rust, Let's build a browser engine!](https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html)
- [ ] [Rust, Writing an OS in Rust (Second Edition)](https://os.phil-opp.com/)
